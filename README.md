# Personal Portfolio

I was amazed that the originator, Sonny Sangha, was able to code this whole thing in a 4 hour live-stream on YouTube. 
It took me probably twenty hours just to code-along, then the same again to personalize the information. 
You too can follow the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urgi2iz9P6U, it's seriously impressive!
